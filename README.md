Tetris in C 

After watching Tetris the movie on Apple+, I decided halfway through, that I wanted to try coding it in C.
As C was the first programming language I studied, I have a lot of respect for it.
Looking around, I decided to use https://www.raylib.com/ and keep it simple and functional.
Happy to share this with you!
